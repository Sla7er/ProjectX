    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <image src="CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></image>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It was developed to allow web developers to separate the content (HTML) from the design (CSS), making web pages more flexible and easier to maintain.

    </br></br> Prior to CSS, web styling was done through inline HTML attributes, which made it cumbersome to update and manage large websites. CSS enables developers to control the look and feel of multiple web pages at once, allowing for more efficient and centralized styling.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Style Text: Control font types, sizes, colors, and spacing.</li>
        <li>Layout Design: Manage how elements like images, text, and buttons are positioned on a page.</li>
        <li>Responsive Design: Use media queries to make websites look good on different devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, desktops).</li>
        <li>Visual Enhancements: Add animations, transitions, shadows, and gradients without needing external graphics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>CSS revolutionized web development by simplifying how websites are designed and maintained, making it a cornerstone of modern web design.</p>
    <h2>The Birth of CSS</h2>
    <p>The birth of CSS is largely credited to Norwegian Håkon Wium Lie, who back in 1994 sought to create a universal standardised style sheet for the World Wide Web.

       <br> The first site that Lie trialled CSS on was the Arena web browser. From its first creation, Lie went on to co-create CSS1, CSS2 and RFC 2318 versions with Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau. In its first decade of existence (1994 – 2004) CSS, in all its specifications, became an established web standard greatly influencing the look and accessibility of the world wide web as we know it today. CSS3 was issued in 1999.
        
       <br> Web standards are a topic that are close to Lie’s heart. Since delivering CSS he has petitioned major technology players such as Microsoft and other browsers to support common web standards and continues to develop CSS’s uses for web printing and pagination on screens. </p>
    <h2>What is the difference between CSS1, CSS2 and CSS3?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS (1996) allows the user to select font style and size and change the colour of the text and background. </li>
    <li>CSS2 (1998) has capabilities that allows the user to design page layout. </li>
    <li>CSS3 (1999) allows the user to create presentations from documents and to select from a wider range of fonts including those from Google and Typecast. Uniquely, CSS3 allows the user to incorporate rounded borders and use multiple columns. CSS3 is considered to be easier to use (when compared to CSS2) because it has different modules </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What about CSS4?</h2>
    <p>The Working Group of W3C (w3.org), the group who discuss all technical aspects of CSS’s progression and answers queries from a public mailing list, are continuously working on improvements within CSS. Rather than creating an entirely new version called CSS4 it seems that the w3.org are adding new, smaller components to the existing CSS versions via extensions. But before we ask where CSS4 is, it’s worth noting that many argue that CSS3 doesn’t exist.  Instead, CSS 3 and 4 are rather terms used to define any updates that happened after CSS2 (and are, therefore, officially called CSS2.1). In these terms, CSS4 has happened but it will never be called CSS4. </p>
    <br><p>Of course, the limits to CSS’s capabilities are endless, hence they are continually developing. CSS-Tricks, a site that covers stories about the development of CSS amongst others, regularly encourages its readers to expand and experiment with CSS. For instance, one story reveals the fun/useful things to try with the Universal (*) selector. For instance, using a border-box on web pages or transitions to pimp a WordPress site. </p>
    <h2>The Future of CSS</h2>
    <p>The future of CSS is bright and full of possibilities. As the web continues to evolve, it will adapt and expand its capabilities. Despite being over two decades old, CSS remains essential to web design and development. It helps designers and developers create better and more effective websites for users. UX improves CSS by providing the visual structure and design elements that make websites aesthetically pleasing and improve usability.</p>
    <p>Without CSS, web pages would still be limited to actual HTML content. It would need more visual appeal and interactivity than users expect from modern websites. CSS transforms the World Wide Web. It also keeps pace with the rapid technological changes to meet the demands of the current web. The future for CSS looks bright with new features and upgrades in web technologies.</p>
    <h2>Impact of CSS on User Experience and Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>CSS plays a pivotal role in creating responsive websites that adapt their layout and content to fit the screen size and orientation of the user’s device.
       <br> This adaptability improves the user experience by ensuring that websites are easy to read and navigate, regardless of the device used to access them.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Media Queries: CSS media queries enable designers to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the user’s device, such as width, height, and orientation. This allows for the creation of flexible layouts that look great on any screen size.</li>
        <li>Flexible Grids: CSS enables the creation of flexible grid systems that adjust to the screen size. By using relative units like percentages rather than fixed units, elements on the page can resize fluidly, maintaining the integrity of the design across devices.</li>
        <li>Flexible Images: CSS also allows images to be made flexible, so they can scale up or down depending on the screen size, ensuring that they do not break the layout or become too small to be functional.</li>
       </ul>
